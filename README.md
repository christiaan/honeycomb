# Honeycomb

**⚠️ This is an experimental version and the API is likely to change. I encourage anyone to try out the API and open an [issues](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/issues/new) if you have any suggestions or questions ⚠️**

Another hex grid library made in ~~JavaScript~~[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), heavily inspired by [Red Blob Games'](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) blog posts and code samples.

Honeycomb works in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. It's recommended to use Honeycomb with TypeScript, but not required.

## Installation

NPM:

```bash
npm i honeycomb-grid@alpha
```

Yarn:

```bash
yarn add honeycomb-grid@4.0.0-alpha
```

Or download the distribution from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/honeycomb-grid@4.0.0-alpha.5).

## Examples

Create a rectangular grid of 10 by 10 hexes and log each hex:

```typescript
import { createHexPrototype, Grid, rectangle } from 'honeycomb-grid'

// 1. Create a hex prototype. This is an object (literally as a JS prototype) that's used by all hexes in the grid:
const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype({ dimensions: 30 })

// 2. Create a grid with this hex prototype and also pass a "traverser" for a rectangular-shaped grid:
//    `start: [0, 0]` means to start the rectangle with "axial coordinates": 0,0 (see Coordinate system)
let grid = new Grid(hexPrototype, rectangle({ start: [0, 0], width: 10, height: 10 }))

// 3. Iterate over the grid to log each hex (notice a new grid instance is returned):
grid = grid.each((hex) => console.log(hex))

// 4. The above won't do anything yet, that's because the "iterative" grid methods are executed lazily.
//    You need to call its run() method in order to execute the each() call (and most other method calls):
grid = grid.run()
```

### Rendering

Honeycomb comes without the ability to render hexes to screen. Fortunately, it isn't very hard. Especially if you use a dedicated rendering library.

Using [SVG.js](http://svgjs.com/):

```typescript
import { Hex } from 'honeycomb-grid'

// it's assumed SVG is present on the window object
const draw = SVG().addTo('body').size('100%', '100%')

function renderSVG(hex: Hex) {
  const polygon = draw
    // create a polygon from a hex's corner points
    .polygon(hex.corners.map(({ x, y }) => `${x},${y}`))
    .fill('none')
    .stroke({ width: 1, color: '#999' })

  return draw.group().add(polygon)
}
```

Using [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/):

```typescript
import { Hex } from 'honeycomb-grid'

// it's assumed PIXI is present on the window object
const app = new PIXI.Application({ transparent: true })
const graphics = new PIXI.Graphics()

document.body.appendChild(app.view)
graphics.lineStyle(1, 0x999999)

function renderCanvas(hex: Hex) {
  const [firstCorner, ...otherCorners] = hex.corners

  // move the "pen" to the first corner
  graphics.moveTo(firstCorner.x, firstCorner.y)
  // draw lines to the other corners
  otherCorners.forEach(({ x, y }) => graphics.lineTo(x, y))
  // finish at the first corner
  graphics.lineTo(firstCorner.x, firstCorner.y)

  app.stage.addChild(graphics)
}
```

Either `render()` function can be used like so:

```typescript
import { createHexPrototype, Grid, rectangle } from 'honeycomb-grid'

// You may want the origin to be the top left corner of a hex's bounding box instead of its center (which is the default)
const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype({ dimensions: 30, origin: 'topLeft' })

new Grid(hexPrototype, rectangle({ start: [0, 0], width: 10, height: 10 }))
  .each(renderSVG) // or: .each(renderCanvas)
  .run()
```

### Coordinate system

There are three types of coordinates and most functions/methods that accept coordinates accept either of these:

1. [Offset coordinates](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-offset), e.g.: `{ col: 1, row: 2 }`
2. [Axial coordinates](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-axial), e.g.: `{ q: 1, r: 2 }` or as a tuple: `[1, 2]`
3. [Cube coordinates](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-cube), e.g.: `{ q: 1, r: 2, s: -3 }` (the sum of all three coordinates must always be 0) or as a tuple: `[1, 2, -3]`

You may also find points (e.g.: `{ x: 1, r: 2 }`) in the library. For example, a hex's `corners` property returns an array of the hex's six corner points.

There are some functions for converting between types of coordinates:

```typescript
import { hexToOffset, hexToPoint, offsetToCube, pointToCube } from 'honeycomb-grid'

offsetToCube(OffsetCoordinates, HexPrototype): CubeCoordinates
pointToCube(Point, HexPrototype): CubeCoordinates

hexToOffset(Hex): OffsetCoordinates
hexToPoint(Hex): Point
```

### Odd or even hex offsets

In a grid with pointy hexes, each row is offsetted half a hex relative to the previous row. In grids with flat hexes, this applies to the columns. Redblobgames.com has a [visual example](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-offset).

Set the offset property to 1 or -1 (default) to control whether the even or odd rows/columns are offsetted.

### Pixel → Hex

Translating a screen pixel to the corresponding hex in a grid is possible with `Grid.pointToHex()`. It also works with irregularly shaped hexes.

```typescript
import { createHexPrototype, Grid, rectangle } from 'honeycomb-grid'

const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype({
  dimensions: { xRadius: 50, yRadius: 30 }, // wide hexes
  origin: 'topLeft'
})
const grid = new Grid(hexPrototype, rectangle({ start: [0, 0], width: 10, height: 10 }))

document.addEventListener('click', ({ offsetX, offsetY }) => {
  const hex = grid.pointToHex({ x: offsetX, y: offsetY })
  console.log(hex)
})
```

### Traversing

In Honeycomb it's possible to *traverse* a grid: iterating over hexes in a specific order. You can then use other iterating methods like `each()`, `filter()` and `takeWhile()` to do whatever you want with those hexes.

Built-in traversers include: `rectangle()`, `ring()`, `spiral()`, `add()` and `line()`.

```typescript
// A traverser can be passed as the 2nd argument to the Grid constructor:
const grid = new Grid(hexPrototype, rectangle({ start: [0, 0], width: 4, height: 4 }))

// or to the traverse() method:
grid.traverse(spiral({ start: [5, 5], radius: 3 }))
```

Traversers can be *chained* by wrapping them in an array. Each consecutive traverser receives the last traversed hex (*cursor*) of the previous traverser.

```typescript
// This traverses over a grid following a triangular path:
grid
  .traverse([
    // Start at the hex with coordinates { q: 0, r: 0 } and move 4 hexes East
    line({ start: [0, 0], direction: Compass.E, length: 4 }),
    // then move 4 hexes Southwest
    line({ direction: Compass.SW, length: 4 }),
    // finally move 3 hexes Northwest to close the triangle
    line({ direction: Compass.NW, length: 3 }),
  ])
  .each((hex) => console.log(hex))
  .run() // logs: Hex {q: 0, r: 0}, Hex {q: 1, r: 0}, Hex {q: 2, r: 0}, …
```

In order to prevent the same hexes are traversed multiple times, **traversers never traverse the cursor they receive from the previous traverser**. This means that when you call a traverser, the first hex will be missing (by default):

```typescript
// This produces a 10x10 grid with the hex in the top left corner missing ⚠️
// (so actually a 9x10 grid)
const grid = new Grid(hexPrototype, rectangle({ width: 10, height: 10 }))
```

This can be fixed by passing the `start` option that should be the hex coordinates the traverser should…well, *start*:

```typescript
// This produces a 10x10 grid as you might expect 😌
const grid = new Grid(hexPrototype, rectangle({ start: [0, 0], width: 10, height: 10 }))
```

Most traversers accept this `start` option as well as an `at` option. `at` behaves the same as `start` but doesn't include the hex at those coordinates. It should be used to make a traverser start *at* coordinates that aren't the cursor's.

> **TL;DR** In most cases: only use `start` when creating a grid or for the first traverser in an array of traversers.

Finally, you can also supply a custom traverser. It's called with:

1. `cursor`: the hex where the previous traverser left off
2. `getHex`: a function that either returns a hex from the grid's store (if present) or creates a new hex

It must return an iterable (usually an array) of hexes:

```typescript
grid.traverse((cursor, getHex) => [getHex(cursor)]) // (this traverser isn't very useful 😬)

// Because a traverser must return an iterable of hexes, generators can be traversers too:
grid.traverse(function*(cursor, getHex) {
  yield getHex([0, 0])
  yield getHex([1, 0])
  yield getHex([0, 1])
})
```

### Stateful and stateless grids

```typescript
import { Grid, rectangle } from 'honeycomb-grid'

// When a grid is created with a traverser…
const statefulGrid = new Grid(hexPrototype, rectangle({ width: 2, height: 2 }))
// …all hexes produced by the traverser are added to a store (a JS Map):
statefulGrid.store  // Map(4) {"0,0" => Hex, "1,0" => Hex, "0,1" => Hex, "1,1" => Hex}
// A grid with a store is a stateful grid and it can be iterated:
statefulGrid
  .filter((hex) => hex.q === 1)
  .each((hex) => console.log(hex))
  .run()  // logs: Hex {q: 1, r: 0}, Hex {q: 1, r: 1}

// If you don't need state and/or want a performance gain, create a stateless grid:
const statelessGrid = new Grid(hexPrototype) // don't pass a 2nd argument
statelessGrid.store // Map(0) {}
// This grid can't be iterated (what hexes and in what order?)
statelessGrid.each((hex) => console.log(hex)).run() // logs nothing
// However, stateless grids can always be traversed:
statelessGrid
  .traverse(add([1, 1])) // traverse a single hex
  .each((hex) => console.log(hex))
  .run()  // logs: Hex {q: 1, r: 1}

// To update a grid's store (add/remove/change hexes), you could do this manually:
const hexToAdd = statefulGrid.getHex([2, 2])
statefulGrid.store.set(hexToAdd.toString(), hexToAdd)
// But this mutates the grid (possibly introducing bugs). Use update() instead:
const anotherHex = statefulGrid.getHex([3, 3])
const updatedGrid = statefulGrid.update((grid) => {
  // grid is a clone of the source grid (statefulGrid), so you can mutate it in-place
  grid.store.set(anotherHex.toString(), anotherHex)
  // you don't have to return the grid
})
statefulGrid.store.get(anotherHex.toString()) // undefined
updatedGrid.store.get(anotherHex.toString()) // Hex {q: 3, r: 3}

```

### Controlling how hexes are created

Whenever Honeycomb creates or clones a hex, the `clone()` method on the hex prototype is called. So by implementing your own version you can control how hexes are created:

```typescript
import { cloneHex, createHexPrototype, Grid } from 'honeycomb-grid'

const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype({
  // `newProps` can be undefined(!), coordinates (offset, axial or cube) or a hex
  clone(newProps) {
    // you can run side-effects here for example
    console.log('Hi there 👋')
    // `this` is set to the hex that's being cloned
    return cloneHex(this, newProps)
  }
})
const grid = new Grid(hexPrototype)

// the following creates a new hex and then calls its clone() method
const hex = grid.getHex([1, 2]) // logs: Hi there 👋
```

If you want to update hexes in a grid, use Grid's `map()` method:

```typescript
import { add, createHexPrototype, Grid } from 'honeycomb-grid'

const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype(/* ... */)
const grid = new Grid(hexPrototype, add([1, 2])) // create a grid with a single hex
const mappedGrid = grid
  .map((hex) => {
    // hex is already cloned, so you can mutate it in-place
    hex.custom = 'custom'
    // you don't even have to return the hex (the cloned hex is used)
  })
  .run()

// the hex in the original grid is unaffected:
grid.getHex([1, 2])       // Hex {q: 1, r: 2}
mappedGrid.getHex([1, 2]) // Hex {q: 1, r: 2, custom: 'custom'}
```

## Playground

The project contains a playground to play around with Honeycomb on your machine. I use this myself to test out new functionality. To use it follow these steps:

1. `git clone git@github.com:flauwekeul/honeycomb.git`
2. `git switch next`
3. `npm run dev` (this starts a server that automatically rebuilds the project to `/dist` when anything in `/src` changes)
4. `npm run playground` (this starts a [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) server running at `http://localhost:1234` with `/playground/index.html` as its entrypoint)
5. Play around with the files in `/playground` (mainly `/playground/index.ts`)

The playground contains `render.ts` to render individual hexes as SVGs and `benchmark.ts` for running comparative performance tests.

## Documentation

I'm planning on writing documentation once the API is (more or less) stable.

## 4.0 Backlog

Features that are crossed out are not going to be added. Checked features are implemented (or not applicable). The rest will probably be implemented.

### General

- [ ] Add a helper to manage grid state better (and remove the "need" to override a global variable to keep track of the grid state). It's probably better to remove the store for now, leave that to the user.
      Something like this:
      ```typescript
      // this helper is supplied by Honeycomb:
      const getGrid = (initialGrid: Grid) => {
        let grid = initialGrid || new Grid();
        // action must have this signature: (grid: Grid) => Grid
        return (...actions) => actions.reduce((grid, action) => action(grid), grid)
      }

      const updateGrid = getGrid()

      document.querySelector('#grid').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        const updatedGrid = updateGrid(
          traverse(/* traversers */),
          filter(/* some filter */),
          map(/* some mapper */),
        )
        // the updated grid can then be used:
        doSomething(updatedGrid)
      });
      ```
- [ ] Rename `each()` to `peak()` or `tap()`, because `each` suggests that it returns nothing.
- [ ] Replace compass class with util functions:
  - [ ]  `vector()`: accepts start coordinates, a direction and length and returns coordinates (`length` can also be a function?)
  - [ ]  `turn()`: accepts start coordinates, a direction and an amount to turn (in degrees or "compass steps"?)
  - [ ]  functions to convert between degrees and compass directions
- [ ] Functions/methods should also accept strings for compass directions.
- [ ] Directions should also be given in degrees (in steps of 30°)?
- [x] ~~Do something with this: [https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage)?~~ A `Map` works fine
- [x] There should be a way to loop over hexes in a grid with **transducers**? Experimented with this and I couldn't get it to work when a grid was traversed multiple times before being run (triggering the transducer). Surprisingly, it had a significant performance drop (more than 50%). Don't know what caused it though, probably the combination of transducers and traversers that don't fit well together. Might investigate more in the future.
- [ ] Add an abstraction for the grid store (currently a plain `Map`). So that instead of doing this: `grid.store.set(someHex.toString(), someHex)`, one can do this: `grid.store.set(someHex)`. Or maybe even separate methods for adding hexes (that throws when the hex is already present), updating hexes (that throws when the hex isn't present) and setting hexes (that doesn't throw when the hex is already present).
- [ ] Add functionality related to [edges](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/issues/58#issuecomment-642099947)
- [x] ~~Do something with matrices?~~ Nah, no need
- [x] ~~Add some generic rendering helpers (a "pen" that "draws" hex edges (for canvas) or a single hex (for SVG))~~ No need: one only needs to map a hex's corners to render a hex. Nearly all code is specific to the render lib.
- [ ] Make sure the lib can be imported as a module (e.g.: `<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/honeycomb-grid/dist/honeycomb.mjs"></script>`). Probably use [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) or [snowpack](https://snowpack.dev).
- [ ] Switch to [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) for publishing releases

### Functions *and* methods

### Grid

#### Terminology

- *grid instance*: an iterable object that represents hexes in a plane (possibly with infinite dimensions). ~~The order of iteration is not important?~~
- *stateful grid*: a grid with a non-empty `store`. The store can be filled when the grid is created by either passing a store or a traverser as the 2nd argument.
- *stateless grid*: a grid with an empty `store`. Create a stateless grid by only passing a hex prototype to the constructor.
- *concrete grid*: a grid instance with finite hexes stored as a concrete data type (array, object, string, etc)
- *grid-like*: an iterable that can be converted to a grid instance
- *traverser*: a ~~generator~~ (generators are not performant, so the built-in traversers are regular array-producing functions, but a traverser can still be a generator) function that determines how a grid instance is traversed. It produces hexes in a certain order.

  The result of a traversal is always a new grid (the traversed grid isn't mutated, the hexes in it can be mutated though), this can be added/subtracted/intersected/differenced, mapped/reduced or just ignored (in case of side-effects).
- *iterator method*: a grid method that iterates over the hexes in the grid (if any). A traverser is also an iterator. Stateful grids can always be iterated (using the store), stateless grids can only be iterated when traversed at least once.

#### API

- [x] **Creation**:
  - [x] `new Grid<T extends Hex>(hexPrototype: T, traverserOrStore?: Traverser<T> | Map<string, T>)`: ~~can be traversed indefinitely, determine default traverser (spiral?) the default traverser doesn't emit hexes~~ A grid without hexes isn't very helpful, so it makes sense to pass a traverser or store (`Map`) to the constructor.
  - [x] ~~`Grid.of<T extends Hex>(/* same args as constructor */)`~~
  - [x] `Grid.from<T extends Hex>(iterable: Iterable<T>)`
- [ ] **Traversal**:
  - [x] `grid.rectangle(options)`
  - [x] ~~`grid.hexagon(options)`~~ see: the `spiral()` traverser
  - [x] ~~`grid.parallelogram(options)`~~ add if requested
  - [x] ~~`grid.triangle(options)`~~ add if requested
  - [x] `grid.spiral(options)` (`grid.ring(options)` would be a spiral that stops)
  - [x] ~~`grid.line(options)`~~ see the `line()` traverser
  - [x] ~~`grid.zigzag(options)`?~~ add if requested
  - [ ] something that uses path finding algorithms like A*?
  - [x] ~~`grid.createTraverser(function* customTraverser(options) {})(options)`~~
  - [x] 👉 Make traversers even more fine-grained (~~seems very complex~~ it is, but worth it!)
- [ ] **Combination**:
  - [ ] `grid.add(otherGrid)` / `grid.union(otherGrid)`
  - [ ] `grid.subtract(otherGrid)`
  - [ ] `grid.intersect(otherGrid)`
  - [ ] `grid.difference(otherGrid)`
  - [x] ~~`grid.mergeMap()` / `grid.zip()`~~ these ~~seem~~ are useless
- [ ] **Assertion**:
  - [ ] ? grid.some() whether any hex passes predicate
  - [ ] ? grid.every() whether all hexes pass predicate
- [ ] **Mutation/reduction**:
  - [x] `grid.update((grid) => void)`
    ```typescript
    // the passed grid is already a clone, similar to Immer
    grid.update((grid) => {
      // grid.hexes() returns the hexes since the last run() call
      grid.store = new Map(grid.hexes().map((hex) => [hex.toString(), hex]))
    })
    ```
  - [ ] `grid.reduce<R>((R, hex, grid) => R, R): R`
  - [x] ~~`grid.toArray(): T[]`~~ see grid's `hexes()` method
  - [x] ~~`grid.toJSON()`~~
  - [x] ~~`grid.toString()` / `grid.serialize()`~~
  - [x] ~~`grid.toLinkedList()`~~
  - [x] ~~`grid.toRecord()`~~
  - [x] ~~`grid.toMap()`~~ (just use `grid.store`)
  - [x] ~~`grid.toSet()`~~

### Coordinates

- [x] Also accept tuples (e.g. `[1, 2]`). These correspond to ~~offset~~ axial coordinates (e.g. `{ q: 1, r: 2 }`).
- [ ] Also accept strings? These strings should be the same as what `hex.toString()` produces (by default separated by a comma `1,2`). But if user overrides `toString()` (and using a different separator, e.g. a pipe: `1|2`), then user is responsible for using the correct separator when they use strings as coordinates.
- [x] Store coordinates as ~~"tuples" (arrays)~~ simple 3D objects. ~~Investigate whether arrays or objects (without prototype?) (maybe even strings, ArrayBuffer?) are more performant.~~
- [x] Take [Amit's advice](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-comparison) and use axial coordinates by default.
  - [x] ~~Use `x`, `y` and `z` for cube coordinates?~~
  - [x] ~~Rename cartesian to offset?~~
  - [ ] Also use [doubled coordinates](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-doubled)?
- [x] Problem: how to differentiate between 2D hex coordinate and 2D "pixel" coordinate?
  **Solution**: `CartesianCoordinates` is an alias of `Point`. A "coordinate" is a point in a grid, a "point" is any 2D/3D point in any system (e.g. a grid).
- [x] ~~Offer `Point()` function (with `add()` etc methods)? And/or a way to convert tuples to points/coordinates?~~ Converting from/to tuples is outside this lib's scope.

### ✅ Hex

- [x] Hexes only have axial coordinates (most methods require axial coordinates anyway).
- [x] Make default origin the center of the hex (currently is top left corner)? Can't remember why it's not already the center.
  - [ ] Add `boundingBox` (with `topLeft`, `topRight`, etc)
  - [x] Origin should also be able to set with a function that's called with the hex prototype (?) so that width, height or corners can be used to determine origin
- [x] ~~Make it possible to use own createHex() functions (this also means hex prototypes aren't set by Honeycomb)?~~ Every time a new hex is created (in `Grid` for example), the `clone()` method is called. This way users can control how hexes are created.
- [ ] Different groups of functions:
  1. Functions that **require both** a hex prototype and a hex (e.g. `toPoint()`)
  2. Functions that require a hex prototype and **optionally a hex** (e.g. `corners()` with just a hex prototype returns the relative corners of any hex, `corners()` with both a hex prototype and a hex returns the absolute corners of the hex)
  3. Functions that require **only** a **hex prototype** (e.g. `width()`)
  4. Functions that require **only** a **hex** (e.g. `equals()`)
  - [x] What to do when group 1 is only called with a hex prototype? ~~Return a function that accepts a hex.~~ Todo: Log a warning
  - [x] (Naming) conventions for these groups?
    - group 1: ~~offer higher order function that accepts a hex prototype (prefixed with `create`, e.g. `createToPoint()`?) and returns a function that accepts a hex. This can be used to create hex prototype methods using partial application (i.e. `hex.toPoint()`).~~ When used as a static method: name start with `hex` (e.g. `hexToPoint()`) and accepts a hex. When used as a prototype method: accepts no arguments (works on instance).
    - group 2: 1st parameter is the hex prototype, 2nd optional parameter the hex. The return value depends on whether the 2nd parameter was passed. This can also be used as a static method on Hex or a prototype method (then the function is partially applied with the hex prototype).
    - group 3: are both available as a static and prototype method.
    - group 4: available as a static method and a partially applied prototype method.
- [x] By default hexes only have coordinates as state. Should be possible for users to add state:
    ```ts
    interface CustomHex {
      customProp: string
      customMethod(): void
    }
    // the properties of CustomHex are available to all hexes (because they're added to the prototype)
    const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype<CustomHex>({ size: 20, customProp: 'custom', customMethod() {} })
    ```
  - [x] how can you type functions that accept hexes? RxJS operators seem to be able to fix this.
- [x] ~~Maybe either have pointy or flat hexes and leave it to rendering if they're pointy or flat?~~ All the `if` statements that check whether hexes are pointy or flat may be resolved by having separate functions for pointy and flat hexes and using those in the Hex prototype. This doesn't seem to improve performance.
- [x] ~~Investigate if memoization helps~~ It doesn't
